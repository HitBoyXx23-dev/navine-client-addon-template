you might get * What went wrong:
Plugin [id: 'fabric-loom', version: '1.6-SNAPSHOT'] was not found in any of the following sources:

- Gradle Core Plugins (not a core plugin. For more available plugins, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.8/userguide/plugin_reference.html in the Gradle documentation.)
- Included Builds (No included builds contain this plugin)
- Plugin Repositories (could not resolve plugin artifact 'fabric-loom:fabric-loom.gradle.plugin:1.6-SNAPSHOT')
  Searched in the following repositories:
    Gradle Central Plugin Repository 

    so either ask chatgpt or in settings.gradle  make it pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        maven {
            name = "Fabric"
            url = "https://maven.fabricmc.net/"
        }
        gradlePluginPortal()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
should fix it
